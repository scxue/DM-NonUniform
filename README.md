## Abstract

Discretization of sampling time steps are mainly hand-crafted designed, such as uniform-t scheme, quadratic-t scheme, uniform logSNR scheme and EDM scheme. We propose an optimization-based method to choose appropriate time steps for a specific numerical ODE solver for Diffusion Models.

## Integration with DPM-Solver, UniPC

Add the following code in "get_time_steps" method in DPM-Solver or UniPC

```python
from step_optim import StepOptim
```

```python
elif skip_type == "optimized":
    optimizer = StepOptim(self.noise_schedule)
    t, _ = optimizer.get_ts_lambdas(N, t_0, optimized_type)
    t = t.to(device).to(torch.float32)
    return t
```

For pixel-space diffusion models, we recommend use "optimized_type" as "unif", which means that the optimization algorithm will use uniform-logSNR steps as initialization; for latent-space diffusion models, we recommend use "optimized_type" = "unif_t", which means that the optimization algorithm will use uniform-time steps as initialization.
